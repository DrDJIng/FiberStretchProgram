# Rather than importing individual classes such as threading.Thread or queue.Queue, this
#   program is doing a simple import and then indicating the package name when the functions
#   are called.  This seemed like a great way for the reader of the code to get an understanding
#   as to exactly which package is being used.  It's purely for educational and explicitness purposes

import threading
import time

# This program has been tested on all flavors of PySimpleGUI and it works with no problems at all
# To try something other than tkinter version, just comment out the first import and uncomment the one you want

"""
    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded GUI
    One method for running multiple threads in a PySimpleGUI environment.
    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread
    Other parts of the software are implemented as threads

    A queue.Queue is used by the worker threads to communicate with code that calls PySimpleGUI directly.
    The PySimpleGUI code is structured just like a typical PySimpleGUI program.  A layout defined,
        a Window is created, and an event loop is executed.
    What's different is that within this otherwise normal PySimpleGUI Event Loop, there is a check for items
        in the Queue.  If there are items found, process them by making GUI changes, and continue.

    This design pattern works for all of the flavors of PySimpleGUI including the Web and also repl.it
    You'll find a repl.it version here: https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Async-With-Queue-Communicationspy
